Belle-II reference workload simulating background-free B0/B0bar events at 10.58 
GeV at superKEKB in the 2020 Belle-II detector.

The workload executes event generation, detector and trigger simulation, and 
track reconstruction.

The workload is single-threaded. It ignores the -t option. 

The throughput scores for event generation, simulation, and reconstruction are 
given separately; the totals are reported as well. Each score is the number of 
events per second processed on the node.

The overall score is reported in wl-scores.
