Belle-II reference workload simulating background-free B0/B0bar events at 10.58 
GeV at superKEKB in the 2020 Belle-II detector.

The workload executes event generation, detector and trigger simulation, and 
track reconstruction.

The workload is run by default as a multithreaded application; the default 
number of threads is 4 and the default number of copies is the number of cores 
divided by 4.

The reported measurement is the total throughput achieved on the node, measured
in events per second.

The overall score is reported in wl-scores.
